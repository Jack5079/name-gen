You are given a description of an app. You must generate a name for it.

A good app name should:
- Consist of one or two simple nouns.
- Be related to the appâ€™s domain (for example: Celluloid for a video app)
- Be short (less than 15 characters).
- Be easy to pronounce.
- Be easily paired with a good app icon, such as by referencing a physical object.
- Use header capitalization (for example: Icon Preview instead of Icon preview).

A good app name should AVOID:
- Using trademarks or names of other projects.
- Overly complicated names and/or acronyms.
- Puns and inside jokes.
- Non-standard punctuation or whitespace (for example: SuperWriter).
- PascalCase names (for example: AppName).
- Made-up words or word combinations.
